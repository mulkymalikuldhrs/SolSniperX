# TODO List for SolSniperX Development

This document outlines the remaining tasks and future enhancements for SolSniperX, aiming to achieve parity with advanced meme coin sniping tools like BullX Neo, GMGN, Dexscreener, and BirdEye.

## High Priority (Immediate Next Steps)

### Frontend Build & Runtime Fixes:
- **Resolve Frontend Compilation Errors:** Address any lingering JSX or import resolution issues preventing successful frontend build.

### Backend:
- **Refine Mempool Monitoring:**
  - Further enhance transaction parsing to accurately identify new token creation, liquidity pool additions/removals, and other relevant on-chain events.
  - Implement more sophisticated filtering to reduce noise from the Solana mempool.
- **Automated Trading Logic Refinement:**
  - Implement more advanced trading strategies within `auto_trader.py` (e.g., dynamic buy/sell amounts based on market conditions, volume-weighted average price (VWAP) analysis).
  - Integrate with a robust order management system to track active positions, PnL, and manage partial fills.
- **Anti-Rugpull Mechanisms Enhancement:**
  - Integrate with external rug-check APIs or on-chain analysis tools for more comprehensive risk assessment.
  - Implement dynamic adjustment of stop-loss and take-profit based on real-time market volatility and rug indicators.

### Frontend:
- **Real-time UI Updates:**
  - Ensure all relevant data (token prices, wallet balances, trade history, auto-trader status, alerts) are updated in real-time via WebSocket connections.
  - Implement toast notifications or other non-intrusive alerts for critical events (new tokens, trades, rugpulls).
- **Automated Trading Configuration UI:**
  - Enhance the settings page with more intuitive controls and explanations for automated trading parameters.
  - Implement validation for user inputs to prevent invalid configurations.
- **Dashboard Data Integration:**
  - Replace mock data on the dashboard with real data fetched from the backend (e.g., total profit, success rate, active positions).

## Medium Priority (Feature Enhancements)

### Backend:
- **Advanced AI Analysis:**
  - Integrate with a real LLM (e.g., OpenAI, custom fine-tuned model) for more sophisticated token analysis.
  - Implement more complex algorithms for risk assessment, sentiment analysis, and viral potential prediction.
- **Advanced Order Types:**
  - Implement limit orders and trailing stop-loss orders through DEX integration.
- **Error Handling & Logging:**
  - Enhance error handling across all services for more informative logging and user feedback.
  - Implement a centralized logging system.

### Frontend:
- **Enhanced UI/UX:**
  - Implement advanced filtering and sorting options for token lists on `TokenScannerPage.jsx`.
  - Develop interactive charts for historical price data on `TokenDetailView` (if implemented).
- **Manual Trading Interface:**
  - Improve manual buy/sell interface with more options (e.g., token selection from wallet, slippage control).

## Low Priority (Future Considerations)

### Backend:
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize data fetching and processing for high-throughput environments.
  - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- **Scalability:**
  - Consider microservices architecture for larger scale deployments.

### Frontend:
- **Mobile Responsiveness:**
  - Ensure full responsiveness across various devices.
- **Theming:**
  - Implement more extensive theming options.

## Completed Tasks (Refer to CHANGELOG.md for details)

- Initial setup and core refactoring.
- Automated Trading Bot Transformation (Backend & Frontend).
